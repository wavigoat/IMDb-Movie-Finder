This program aims to solve the problem of finding and filtering movies from a vast database using various attributes such as genre, director, and rating. With thousands of movies in the IMDb dataset, users may struggle to efficiently search for movies based on their preferences.

This program runs using the Clion IDE. After running the program, input the genres you are searching for into the terminal. Then, input the minimum number of ratings for your search. Type 't' if you want the top 5 movies that fit the parameters you inputted, and 'r' if you want 5 random movies that fit the parameters you inputted.
